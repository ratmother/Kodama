Kodama

Towards a emotional spacial responsive system

A lot of the research and application in AI is centered around utility for companies, and ultimately capital. There is a lot of thought and work given towards the idea of an AI which understands the 'why', or AI which better mirrors the world. Kodama is a move to redirect the goals and paths of the utility of machine learning. 

Instead of mirroring the world (datasets, detected objects, models), we work with the philosophy of adding or multiplying the world. Accuracy to replication is not the goal. 

This idea isn't new, companies such as Facebook and Google are able to multiply users worlds within their system with intricate suggestion algorithms leveraging state of the art machine learning techniques. The problem with is it is their system and their bottom line. Advertising and user retention. While they are pushing boundaries of technology, they ultimately restrict the boundaries of users. The user is kept within coddled architecture by whatever means has been understood to extend their stay. The user is not in a relationship with the system but a casuality or victim of it, not unlike livestock. The only way to influence suggestion systems such as Youtube is to partake in what the suggestion system pre-intuits is desirable behaviour. 

The ability for machine learning to create content treadmills that retain attention is terrifying, mostly because the intent behind the system is not unlike television. It is refined television, the pace at which the television can update its content cycle is a few order of magnitudes faster and on top of this, it is capable of targeting the individual. This genius move leverages Youtubes vast amount of content. 

under written warning

To undermine this the idea is to create a living system with superfical mood-states and responsivness, the underlying intent is not hidden but not explicitable or intending control. Say the system notices the user is very neutral or very sad, it could attempt to show funny imagery, in could play fun music or it could just play neutral or sad music. In this case, the explicit action of the system allows for more nuanced learning -- it tests how the user REACTs to these attempts at mood changing, something a recoomendation system intent on proviidng the user with their desires for the purposes of retention cannot risk doing (regardless of it being potentially worthwhile in the long run, its obvious by now companies rarely see very far ahead of thesemlves).on top of this, nothing is considered 'negative' or 'positive' outright, the system learns tyical reactions in learning-states and then reacts to those reactions in the futures with this information. this could be changed in some intialization parameter or breding. 

The system then acts as an entity or 'friend', the system could have different configurations or personaltiies, bias for certain types of content, etc. User can throw away different congifurations if they dont like them, breed them, etc. potential for users to collect these 'highly personalized content interactors', share them, etc. all in all an absurd idea that runs counter intutively to the 'hidden' livestockization on youtube etc. re-situates user-data learning to be a product of the user(s). 

The re-situating of a suggestion machine from retention-oriented to experienced and interaction oriented is key, it is also likely to be unpopular unless executed quite well. The rise of something like youtube is not a criminal injection, it is within the trend of advertisment entertainment. the only utility it has is potentially therapy, intrigue, background tech. background tech is interesting, because it doesnt nessesarily want attention, it will have learned something to do when there is no one about. i picture it being in a space with people relaxing, like it is some kind of mood machine. 

IT should take the sounds it hears to produce sounds with! come on ! thats great... lot of work though. or maybe find similar sounds to what its hearing, really love that idea.


with the ability to take into account mood and business, the addition of the utilization of the cadence and brightness of the sound is super key.... I belive the entire project rests on this now. we could do the same with images, but that has proven somewhat problematic and difficult... there is time though. i highly reccomend this idea be fleshed out as it affirms the project as having an actual not-utilitarian utility rather than just being a half-idea like it is without the sound-reflection IT IS KEY
